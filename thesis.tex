\section{Thesis statement}
\textbf{TODO:} More details about research goals and needs proper conclusion

% intro: main objective
The main objective of this thesis is to study spoof trading in Northern European stock exchanges. This research attempts to explain phenomena of spoof trading itself, market conditions in which manipulator is likely to commence spoof trading and examine differences of the orders that are utilised in spoof trading compared to regular stock market trading. 

% limitation: confirmation of spoof trading could too challenging since traders' intent is hard to quantify
In spoof trading trader intentionally submits deceptive trade order into exchange in order to falsify true demand or supply of a security. The categorization of an order as genuine or artificial beyond no doubt via data analytical means is difficult, since in isolation any kind of trade is permitted, even if the trade does not conform to common trading behaviour or is even harmful to the trader. As a result the assessment of order's genuineness through quantitative analysis is always at the mercy of an inspector.

% modification of plan: study of circumstances that would enable spoof trading
For above reason, estimate about existence of spoof trading is at best vague and it is not possible with data analytical means to truly confirm spoof trading phenomena. Hence, it is necessary to study logical connections that are interconnected with spoof trading. In spoof trading the most defining aspect is the link between trade imbalance and price changes, as manipulator attempts to influence price of a security through deceptive orders.

% research goal: do trade imbalances cause price shifts
This thesis will firstly explore how trade imbalances do affect security prices. More precisely whether increased demand of an asset will lead to rise in the price, and conversely increase in supply of an asset will cause price to decrease. This behaviour would be in accordance with the laws of supply and demand, but the difference is in the essence of buy-sell-imbalance of an asset. 

% research goal: determine existence of spoof trading
In spoof trading this imbalance is artificial and won't be corrected until cancellation of the spoof order, while in normal trading imbalances should fluctuate more smoothly. Then by studying the nature of these trade imbalances, it is potentially possible to determine whether spoof trading occurs in Northern European stock exchanges. 

% research goal: explore market circumstances & study spoof orders
In case spoof trading was detected, the last step is to study other characteristics of the spoof orders and the market circumstances in which spoof trading is likely to occur.

% Conclusion: list of steps as in research plan
In conclusion this thesis pursues following research goals:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Study whether trade imbalances lead to price changes.
	\item Attempt to identify spoof trading and confirm its' existence in Northern European stock market.
	\item Study how spoof trading differs from regular trading.
	\item Describe the market situations in which spoof trading is likely to happen.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Literature review}
\textbf{TODO:} Needs new ending, and more (technical) sources in comments

% Allen and Gale's research
Allen and Gale \parencite*{AllenGale1992} initially argued that under asymmetrical buy and sell liquidity of a stock, buy and sale orders lead to different price responses, which can create opportunities for profitable price manipulation. They developed theoretical framework to prove that an uninformed trader is able profit by commencing in transaction-based stock price manipulation. Uninformed trader does not possess any insider information about the asset. Transaction-based stock manipulation is based on influencing stock prices only through orders without doing any external actions such as misinforming other traders.

% Jarrow's research and theoretical foundation
Jarrow \parencite*{Jarrow1992} studied potential market manipulation strategies by large traders, showing large traders, even if they do not possess insider information, have enough market power to be able to manipulate market prices through their sheer size of orders. Allen and Gale in addition to Jarrow's research proved theoretical existence of spoof trading, enabling researchers to study the phenomena in real market.

% Empirical intro
Numerous empirical studies have shown market manipulation is worldwide phenomena: Aggarwal and Wu \parencite*{AggarwalWu2006}, Aktaş and Doğanay (2006, see \cite{OgutDoganayAktas2009}), Lee at al. \parencite*{LeeEomPark2009}, and Kong and Wang \parencite*{KongWang2014} showed evidence of spoof order manipulation in US, Turkey, Korea, and China respectively.

% Aggarwal and Wu in US
Aggarwal and Wu \parencite*{AggarwalWu2006} extended framework developed by Allen and Gale and studied how information seekers affect trading. They found that informed parties, corporate insiders, brokers, underwriters, large shareholders and market makers, may worse market efficiency and are more likely to be manipulators. When studying U.S equity market, they found that manipulating mostly happens in small, illiquid and inefficient markets.

% Lee et al in Korea
Lee at al \parencite*{LeeEomPark2009} studied buy-orders in KRX Korea Exchange. They found the susceptible stocks to spoofing behaviour tend to have higher return volatility, lower market capitalization, lower price levels and lower managerial transparency. Also when exchange stopped disclosing the total quantity of buy and sell sides, so that spoofing orders could no longer be used to mislead investors, spoofing dramatically declined. In general spoofing orders were much bigger than typical orders and usually at least 10 ticks away from the current price, thus executability of spoofing orders were extremely low, consequently confirming the intent of manipulation. \autocite{LeeEomPark2009}

% Critisism of Lee at al research
However in the study of Lee et al. spoofing order was defined as "\textit{a bid/ask with a size at least twice the previous day’s average order size and with an order price at least 6 ticks away from the market price, followed by an order on the opposite side of the market, and subsequently followed by the withdrawal of the first order}" \autocite[p. 11]{LeeEomPark2009}. This kind of precise definition of spoofing order surely affects the results they will gather from their analysis. % FIX

% Kong and Wang in China
Kong and Wang \parencite*{KongWang2014} found that market statistics of manipulation cases, like price, volume, turnover ratio volatility and liquidity, were in accordance with previous studies. Also market manipulators tend to target specific time periods of greater information asymmetry, then manipulators are able to present themselves as informed traders and affect behaviour of other investors in the short-term, while in the long-term the effects of manipulation disappear. \autocite{KongWang2014}

% What is different in my research
In the previously mentioned studies data was labelled in advance or labelled using fixed rules as manipulative or non-manipulative. Lee et al. used rule-based approach, other studies used court rulings to define manipulative trades. This inherently causes the subjects of studies were only incompetent manipulators who were caught or classified using arbitrary manual rules. None of the studies adopted pure data analytical viewpoint of detecting spoofing behaviour in stock-wide context, which I will study in my thesis.

% limitation in current research, need to merge with previous paragraph
To date most of the spoofing behaviour research only concerns study of spoofing orders. The orders are deterministically identified either as normal stock market behaviour or spoofing behaviour, then spoofing orders' characteristics and impact is further studied. Mostly used identification methods are technical rule-based methods or based on court rulings orders are identified as illegal spoofing behaviour. This however limits the study of

\section{Data}
\textbf{TODO:} Provide more details about data

% introduction of data
This thesis utilises stock market data in Northern European exchanges to study spoofing behaviour. The data was provided by thesis director Professor Juho Kanninen from department of industrial management in Tampere University of Technology. The data of each stock was collected from 1.6.2010 to 31.5.2013, which results to the total of 765 trading days worth of data per stock. \textbf{QUESTION:} Is this date format correct?
% FIX: Date format?

% details of data
For each stock data consists of daily message book and order book. Message books includes all the orders of a stock submitted to the exchange and order book data describes changes in order book during the day. In addition daily summaries of successful trades, submitted limit orders, and cancellations made by traders are provided. % FIX: More details

% introduce table
Table \ref{table:companies} introduces stock market information about companies researched in this thesis. Two of the companies are listed in OMX Nordic Helsinki, two in OMX Nordic Stockholm and one is listed in OMX Nordic Copenhagen exchanges, hence all the biggest northern European stock exchanges are 
covered.

% Problem: small sample size
However, within the exchanges sample size is very small. By November 2017 in total 320 companies were listed in OMX Nordic Stockholm, 53 companies in OMX Nordic Helsinki, and 137 companies in OMX Nordic Copenhagen \autocite{GlobeNewswire2018b}. For example in OMX Nordic Helsinki, the exchange with fewest listed stocks of mentioned three exchanges, two companies out of 53 is only coverage of few percentage points. Due to small sample size the predictive power of this study is low. Inference of spoofing behaviour in country-wise exchanges is limited, thus it is not possible to generalize the results and estimate the scale of spoofing behaviour in the exchanges.

% Limitations of data: similarity
Stock-wise information of companies is presented in table \ref{table:stocks}. The table clearly shows similarity of data: market capitalizations, daily average prices (per currency), and daily trade volumes all are at the same magnitude. Similarity of data further hinders predictive power of this study. The sample is not diverse, and thus does not provide good sample of all the stocks, which are much more diverse.

% Limitations of data: spoofing not very probable in this sample
In addition to data similarity, all of the stocks' market capitalisations are relatively big, daily average prices rather expensive and the stocks are traded very actively. According to research, susceptible stocks to spoofing behaviour on the contrary tend to have lower market capitalisation and lower average price \autocite{LeeEomPark2009, AggarwalWu2006, MeiWuZhou2004}. As a consequence, the stocks in this research are not very probable targets of spoof order manipulators. 

% Limitations of data: false positives
Since the occurrences of spoofing behaviour is low, especially in this data set, false positives might over-populate findings effectively reducing the probability of detecting true spoof trading.
% FIX: TRUE? SOURCE? https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/176384/do-underpowered-studies-have-increased-likelihood-of-false-positives

% Limitations of data: lack of user identity
The most limiting constraint of the data is the lack of user identity. Trades in the daily order books have unique id, but the traders of the orders are not identified, thus destroying ability to track series of orders. As a result, it is not possible to establish logically valid patterns to study spoofing behaviour, instead each order has to be considered in isolation, only examining single order at time and determining whether it is spoofing order or not. 

% Limitations of data: detection of intermarket manipulation
This thesis only focuses on stock market, since only stock market data was provided for this research. As a consequence spoofing behaviour detection of intermarket manipulation is not possible. Manipulator might attempt to manipulate underlying of a derivative, e.g. submit spoofing orders at the stock market while gaining profits in derivatives of the manipulated assets.

% Conclusion & study of factors affecting 
In conclusion because of these limitations it is very unlikely to find spoofing behaviour in this data set, and further draw any interference how common spoofing behaviour is in Northern European stock market. However, if this thesis is able to capture spoofing trading, then it is rather probable that the spoof trading phenomena exists in Northern European stock markets.

\chapter{Financial markets}
\textbf{PLAN:} Overall introduction to financial markets, introduction of order types and other essential financial terms

% introduction
Financial market is a market in which its' participants buy and sell financial assets. The mission of a financial market is to bring together buyers and the sellers in the market. The trades in financial markets are bilateral, two sides of an trade are connected through the market but the underlying asset and payment are exchanged only between the trading sides, markets do not engage in the trades.

% categorization of financial markets
Financial markets are divided into exchange-traded markets and over-the-counter (OTC) markets. In exchange markets market participants trade exchange standardized contracts while in OTC markets two parties are free to define contracts by themselves. Exchange markets are mainly divided by their geographical location, but also further categorized by the instruments they trade. Most common types of exchange markets include stock markets, bond markets, and various derivatives markets such as futures markets and options markets. \autocite{Hull2017}

% limit and market orders
In exchange-traded markets traders mainly submit limit orders or market orders to buy and sell financial assets. In limit orders trader makes a bid to buy or sell a decided amount of financial instruments at a maximum purchase price or minimum selling price. Market order buys a financial instrument at lowest selling prices or sells one at the highest buying prices, all until whole volume of the market order is consumed.

% Order book
Each asset in the market place generally has many limit orders, both buy and sell side, waiting to be traded. These set of limit orders then creates an order book for the underlying asset.

In the order book new row has been created at the price since such price level didn't exist before with the full quantity of 2500 units. Market price of the asset didn't change, the bold row is the same as before, since no trade was made, only the demand was increased.

% Market function: provide liquidity

% introduce second table: new market order
Table \ref{table:new_market_order} shows order book after, in addition to previous limit order, new sell-side market order of 1500 units was processed. Firstly, the asset was traded at the best buying price which shows as the aggregate demand at 54.30 was decreased by the whole market order size of 1500 units. Secondly, since new trade was made the market price was also adjusted to 54.30, which shows as change in place of bold row in the table.

% Market function: price discovery
This change in market price is called price discovery process.

\section{Spoof trading}
\textbf{PLAN:} Explain spoof trading, confirm its' illegality, define spoofing order

% Intro
Market manipulation is considered as a method of artificially affecting price of a security. FIX: SOURCE???

% A generic price manipulation tactic is defined as artificially pushing up (or down) the bid (or ask) price of a security and taking advantage of the shifted price so as to make a profit [12].

\autocite{KyleViswanathan2008}

% Explanation of spoofing strategy
In spoof trading manipulator attempts to simulate fake demand or supply for an asset and after other investors utilize this fake information in their trading, consequently causing price of the asset change, 

% Description of successful spoof trading
A successful case of spoof trading divides into following separate stages: manipulator feigns demand or supply of an asset, price of the assets distorts favourably for manipulator, manipulator makes her genuine trade at the distorted price, manipulator cancels her original fake order, markets adapt and price returns to normal, then manipulator is able to gain profit since she was able to dictate the price process of manipulated asset.

% Definition of spoof order by Lee et al.
Lee at al \parencite*{} defines spoofing order as "\textit{a bid/ask with a size at least twice the previous day’s average order size and with an order price at least 6 ticks\footnotemark away from the market price, followed by an order on the opposite side of the market, and subsequently followed by the withdrawal of the first order}.

\footnotetext{Tick size determines smallest allowed change in security price.}

spoofing order as an order that a trader submits to exchange without intention of execution, instead aiming to distort other market participants' perception of asset's price by providing misleading information about true demand or supply of a asset. 

% Defining spoofing order

% EU Market Abuse regulation
The market abuse regulation set by European Council states "market manipulation shall comprise ... a transaction, placing an order to trade or any other behaviour which: (i) gives, or is likely to give, false or misleading signals as to the supply of, demand for, or price of, a financial instrument ..." \autocite{EU-596-2014} In accordance with the market abuse regulation spoofing behaviour is indisputably prohibited method of market manipulation.

% Jarrow's categorization
Allen and Gale categorized market manipulation into action-based, information-based and transaction-based manipulation as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{action-based manipulation} is based on external actions (other than trading) that can influence price of an asset.
	\item \textit{information-based manipulation} is based on releasing false information to affect price of an asset.
	\item \textit{transaction-based manipulation}	is based on manipulator affecting price of an asset through trading.\autocite*{AllenGale1992}
\end{enumerate}

% Another category by Kong and Wang
Kong and Wang \cite*{KongWang2013} introduced another category of manipulation, namely order-based manipulation which involves order actions but not trade actions. They further asserted 

% Redundancy of the categorization by Kong and Wang
However I will argue this further classification is redundant. In Allen and Gale's categorization transaction-based manipulation can be interpret as manipulation that is not neither action-based nor information-based, that is manipulation without any external actions or information. Consequently making spoofing as a form of transaction-based manipulation, rather than belonging to a new category of manipulation on its own.

% Conclusion about categorization
In conclusion, regardless of whether applying further categorization by Kong and Wang or not, it is more significant to remark what spoofing behaviour is not. Spoofing behaviour does not belong neither action-based nor information-based manipulation, for this reason it is manipulation that does not contain any external actions taken nor exploitation of information outside of trading. As a consequence, the analysis of spoofing behaviour solely on trading data is justified.

- different types of methods (that are only used in this thesis or all kinds of?)
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Classification based: classifier is trained to detect normal data, if new data point has extreme value it is likely to be anomaly
	\item Clustering based: divide data into clusters, check if new data point belongs to any major clusters, anomalies should be separate 
	\item Nearest neighbour based: data points are given anomaly score, new data has the same score as its' neighbours
	\item Statistical based: make statistical analysis of data, i.e. according to some distribution, outliers are likely to be anomalies
	\item Subspace based: create new features of data sets, if new features cannot predict new data point it is likely to be anomaly
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Results}
\textbf{PLAN:} Explain practical research process
- imbalance in demand and supply lead to favourable price change which can be further exploited

In the context of this research, a case of spoofing trading is considered as follows: Firstly manipulator in order to distort asset prices submits a limit order to supply fake information to the market about the asset. Then after favourable change in price of the asset, manipulator makes her real trade. Subsequently she cancels original limit order hoping that the price will recover, and she is able to ???

In order to empirically study spoof trading, we need to address a few nuances that arise from this scenario. What are defining characteristics of these two intervening order, how they are interconnected; what are the favourable changes in prices; ???. 

Manipulator has two two courses of actions, she either attempts to deflate or to inflate the price of an asset. In the case of price of asset falls as a consequence of market manipulation, market had excess supply of the assets, so manipulator submitted an sell side limit order. 

In this study it is not possible to identify these two separate orders by trader since order information is anonymous. As a result, 

Since it is not possible to determine whether manipulator was or was not able to gain profit through her manipulation, the main phase of this thesis is study are there cases in the data where trade imbalances lead to predictable price behaviour.
